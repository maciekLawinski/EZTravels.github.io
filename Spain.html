    <h1>Hotels</h1>
    <h2>The Hat Madrid(Student)</h2>
    <p>This hotel is honestly perfect for students. It’s super affordable but still really comfortable, and even though it’s a two-star place, it has everything you actually need. They offer shared rooms, which means you get a great social vibe and plenty of chances to meet people and make awesome memories. You get 24/7 reception, free super-fast Wi-Fi, laundry facilities (washer + dryer), secure lockers, and loads of other useful stuff. The Hat Madrid isn’t close to a beach—you’ll need to hop on a bus or train—but it totally makes up for it with the nightlife. The bar district is only about a 10-minute walk away, so there’s always something fun to do.</p>
